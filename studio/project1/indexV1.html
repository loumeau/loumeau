    		<div class="spacer"></div>
    		<div class="bubbleEster">
    			<p>He’s at the sanitary. He really wants to stop drinking, Oliver. He’s trying very hard. I know he is. But.. What.. what is it? What is it that makes him want to destroy himself? You.. You’ve known him longer than anyone else, tell me.. What it is.. Please I don’t care. But just tell me.</p>
    		</div>
    		<div class="spacer"></div>
    		<div class="bubbleEster">
    			<p>Well i’ve got to find the answer. You don’t know what it is like to watch someone you love just crumble away bit by bit, day by day, in front of your eyes... and stand there helpless. Love isn’t enough. I thought it was. But love isn’t enough for him. I’m afraid of what’s beginning to happen… within me. Because sometimes I hate him. I hate his promises to stop. And then the watching and waiting to see it begin again. And to go home to him at night. Listen to his lies. Well my heart goes out to him because he tries… he does try. But I hate him for failing. I hate me too. I hate me because I failed too. I have. I don’t know what’s gonna happen to us Oliver. No matter how much you love someone how do you live up the days… how. </p>
